        Planting: `
            Sow seeds directly in the garden or containers. Do not transplant. Try to distribute seed in an even fashion so seeds don’t grow together, use a seed-sower, or thin vigorously to the right space.
            Carrots need a location that receives full sunlight, though they can tolerate partial shade, too. 
            As discussed above, soil must be loose, sandy, and airy so that carrot roots can easily push down through the soil.
            Sow seeds outdoors 3 to 5 weeks before the last spring frost date. Find your local frost dates here. 
            Sow ¼ inch deep, 3 to 4 inches apart in rows 1 foot apart.
            Cover with a layer of vermiculite or fine compost to prefvent a crust from forming (which would hamper germination).
            For multiple harvests, sow seeds about every 3 weeks.
            Keep the soil moist with frequent shallow waterings. For small carrot seeds to germinate, the soil mustn’t form a hard crust on top. (If you put your finger in the ground, it should be moist, but not wet, to the middle knuckle.)
            Carrots are sometimes slow to germinate. They may take 2 to 3 weeks to show leaf, so don’t panic if your carrots don’t appear right away!

        Care: `
            Gently mulch carrots to retain moisture, speed germination, and block the sun from hitting the roots directly.
            When seedlings are an inch tall, thin so that they stand 3 to 4 inches apart. Snip tops with scissors instead of pulling them out to prevent damage to the fragile roots of the remaining plants.
            Water at least one inch per week to start, then two inches as roots mature.
            Weed diligently, but be careful not to disturb the young carrots’ roots while doing so.
            Fertilize with a low-nitogen but high-potassium and -phosphate fertilizer 5 to 6 weeks after sowing. (Note that excess nitrogen in the soil promotes top, or foliage, growth—not roots.)
